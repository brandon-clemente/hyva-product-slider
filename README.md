Hyva Product Slider

I implemented the product slider by adapting the existing product carousel widget, simplifying it by removing unnecessary settings and options.

Installation Guide: Copy the BuyitDirect/PageBuilderProductSlider to app/code, run bin/magento setup:upgrade, run bin/magento cache:flush


Some Issues:
The "Limit" and "Sort By" is not working on "Condtion" option from "Select Products By". However, it is working fine for "SKU"
The "Per View" is a bit buggy when setting the number to more than 4

Next to do:
Make it compatible with LUMA Theme
